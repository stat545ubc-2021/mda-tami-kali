## Mini Data Analysis Project ##
- includes all file data for the mini data analysis project 
- focus is on the *cancer_data* set 

- includes 3 folders, which organize all three milestones for the project (milestone 1, 2, 3), which contain the  the .rmd file, and .md file (accompanied by  .png files: graphs produced by the code) 
# milestone 1 # 
focused on identifying the data set to analyse - during this exploratory process, I decided to focus on the *cancer_data* set 
# milestone 2 # 
focused on exploring 4 research questions that were identified in milestone 1, using methods of analysis, accompanied by an appropriate graphing exercise - during this process, I chose 2 research questions to focus on 
# milestone 3 # 
the final step of the mini data analysis project
